## By Michael Mathews 2025

# How to use
1.) Download the project.
2.) Import said project into Java FX supporting IDE (Most modern popular IDEs do...)
3.) You can open the userInfo.txt and update/add/change username,password combos. It is a text file for easy editing but feel free to encrypt it for actual security.
4.) Run the Window.java
5.) User the username,password combos to login or get an incorrect login info message.
6.) Enjoy
